hydroapp
========

This is a nearly trivial Express application that displays selected
graphs for my hydroponics setup. It points at the RRD file maintained
by the hydroctl application which is capturing light levels, temperature
and humidity.

I have no doubt this will application will become more complex over time,
but for the moment, we're going to keep it simple.
